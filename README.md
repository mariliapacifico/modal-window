<h2>Modal Window</h2>

<hr />

<p>
  This is a Modal Window developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript during "The Complete JavaScript Course" by Jonas Schmedtmann.
</p>

<p>
  The window has three buttons which open modals with a transparent overlay and a cool white text page! ðŸ˜Ž
</p>

<p>
  If you want to close the modal, there's no problem at all. You can either click the close button, click outside the modal or press your Esc key! Great, right?
</p>

<p>I could learn a lot about class manipulation with this project!</p>
